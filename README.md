## :three: Three Concepts 

Before I came up with my final concept, I had a brainstorm session and thought of three concepts.

![RTW_three_concepts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57795294/114388314-cefb3700-9b93-11eb-9f12-ff754daff115.png)

## :link: API
### :question: Which API did I use?

Artist Guesser has been designed and developed with the [Rijksmuseum API](https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/object-metadata/api/).  

For this project I used the *Collection API*, with which you can search the collection.

</br>

### :eyes: What can you do with this API?

_All information can also be found on [the Rijksmuseum website](https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/object-metadata/api/)_

The below described possibilities apply to the Collection API.

- Get a link to the art object on the Rijksmuseum website
- Get the artworks:
  - ID
  - Object number
  - Title
  - Long title
  - Image
  - Artist

</br>

### :raising_hand: What did I do with this API?

I have implemented the following points into **_Artist Guesser_**:

<!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->


</br>

### :end: Endpoint & parameters

TBD
<!-- Gifinder uses one main endpoint, which can be seen below.  

```
https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/[parameters here]?&api_key=${key}`
```  

</br>

I used the parameters below to get different data.
- `${trendingType}`
- `${req.params.id}`

</br>

The `${trendingType}` parameter fetches the trending GIFs at the moment. When using the trendingType parameter, the following needs to be added at the very end `&limit=24`. The limit can be changed to any number.  

</br>

The `${req.params.id}` parameter fetches a specific GIF by ID and gets the data that belongs to that ID.

-->

</br>

### :microphone: API response
After making a request to the API, you will receive some information about the artworks. Below you can find what information you get and what it means.

```
"artObjects": [
  {
    "links": {}               // links to the artwork in the api or website
    "id":                     // ID of the artwork
    "objectNumber":           // object number of the artwork
    "title":                  // artworks title
    "longTitle":              // artworks long title
    "principleOrFirstMaker":  // artworks artist
    "hasImage":               // tells us if the artwork has an image
    "showImage":              // tells us if an image is being shown
    "permitDownload":         // tells us if the image is allowed to be downloaded
    "webImage": {}            // the web image
    "headerImage": {}         // the header image
  }
]
```

## :gift: Used packages

### :smiling_imp: nodemon
[Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is a tool that helps with the development of node.js based applications. The nodemon package restarts the node application automatically when any file changes are made inside the directory.

</br>

I installed nodemon to quickly see whether the changes I made caused any errors, and also for the convenience that comes with automatic restarts.

```
npm i -g nodemon
```

</br>

### :monorail: express
[Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is a node.js framework. 

</br>

I installed express, because this package makes routing via the server easier. Another reason for installing express, was the support for many template engines, as I used one for this project, but hadn't decided on one just yet.

```
npm i express
```
```
const express = require('express');
```

</br>

### :memo: ejs
[Ejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs) is a template engine that makes it possible for JavaScript code to be injected into the client.

</br>

I installed ejs, because the package is easy to understand, has a gentle, gradual learning curve (which makes it great for newbies - like me!) and using the package makes it easier to inject data from the server into the client.

```
npm i ejs
```
```
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
```

</br>

### :socks: socket.io
[Socket.io](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io) is a package that enables real-time event-based communication. This can be done using a NodeJS server and a JavaScript client library for the browser.

</br>

I installed socket.io to implement the real-time chat feature for my project.

```
npm i socket.io
```
```
const socket = require('socket.io')
```
```
const io = socket(http)
```

</br>

### :dog::soccer: node-fetch
[Node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) is a module which works just like the ```window.fetch``` method does client side, but for the server side.

</br>

I installed node-fetch, because it allows me to do an API fetch via the server side.

```
npm i node-fetch
```
```
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
```

</br>

### :large_blue_circle: dotenv
[Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) is a package that loads variables from a ```.env``` file.

</br>

I installed dotenv, because it helps to store sensitive data (such as the API key), which can then be hidden from the GitHub repository using my ```.gitignore``` file.

```
npm i dotenv
```
```
require('dotenv').config();
```

</br>
