## :link: API
### :question: Which API did I use?

Artist Guesser has been designed and developed with the [Rijksmuseum API](https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/object-metadata/api/).  

For this project I used the *Collection API*, with which you can search the collection.

</br>

### :eyes: What can you do with this API?

_All information can also be found on [the Rijksmuseum website](https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/object-metadata/api/)_

The below described possibilities apply to the Collection API.

- Get a link to the art object on the Rijksmuseum website
- Get the artworks:
  - ID
  - Object number
  - Title
  - Long title
  - Image
  - Artist

</br>

### :raising_hand: What did I do with this API?

I have implemented the following points into **_Artist Guesser_**:

<!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->


</br>

### :end: Endpoint & parameters
<!-- Gifinder uses one main endpoint, which can be seen below.  

```
https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/[parameters here]?&api_key=${key}`
```  

</br>

I used the parameters below to get different data.
- `${trendingType}`
- `${req.params.id}`

</br>

The `${trendingType}` parameter fetches the trending GIFs at the moment. When using the trendingType parameter, the following needs to be added at the very end `&limit=24`. The limit can be changed to any number.  

</br>

The `${req.params.id}` parameter fetches a specific GIF by ID and gets the data that belongs to that ID.

</br> -->

### :microphone: API response
<!-- After making a request to the API, you will receive some information about the GIFs. Below you can find what information you get and what it means.

```
{
"type":                // the type of image (mostly all GIFs)
"id":                  // unique ID of the GIF
"url":                 // URL of the GIF, on Giphy.com
"slug":                // GIFs unique slug (used in the url)
"bitly_gif_url":       // short URL, linking to Giphy.com
"bitly_url":           // short URL, linking to Giphy.com
"embed_url":           // embed URL
"username":            // username of who posted the GIF
"source":              // original source of the GIF
"title":               // GIFs title
"rating":              // GIFs MPAA-style rating, such as Y, G, PG, PG-13 and R
"content_url":         // content URL, currently unused by Giphy
"source_tld":          // top level domain of the original source
"source_post_url":     // URL of the webpage on which the GIF was found
"is_sticker":          // stating if the GIF can be used as a web sticker
"import_datetime":     // the creation or upload date from the GIF
"trending_datetime":   // the date on which this GIF was marked as trending
"images": {}           // containing data for different formats and sizes of the GIF
                       // such as original, downsized, fixed-height, fixed-width and stills
}
```

## :gift: Used packages

### :smiling_imp: nodemon
[Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is a tool that helps with the development of node.js based applications. The nodemon package restarts the node application automatically when any file changes are made inside the directory.

</br>

I installed nodemon to quickly see whether the changes I made caused any errors, and also for the convenience that comes with automatic restarts.

```
npm i -g nodemon
```

</br>

### :monorail: express
[Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is a node.js framework. 

</br>

I installed express, because this package makes routing via the server easier. Another reason for installing express, was the support for many template engines, as I used one for this project, but hadn't decided on one just yet.

```
npm i express
```
```
const express = require('express');
```

</br>

### :memo: ejs
[Ejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs) is a template engine that makes it possible for JavaScript code to be injected into the client.

</br>

I installed ejs, because the package is easy to understand, has a gentle, gradual learning curve (which makes it great for newbies - like me!) and using the package makes it easier to inject data from the server into the client.

```
npm i ejs
```
```
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
```

</br>

### :large_blue_circle: dotenv
[Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) is a package that loads variables from a ```.env``` file.

</br>

I installed dotenv, because it helps to store sensitive data (such as the API key), which can then be hidden from the GitHub repository using my ```.gitignore``` file.

```
npm i dotenv
```
```
require('dotenv').config();
```

</br>

### :dog::soccer: node-fetch
[Node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) is a module which works just like the ```window.fetch``` method does client side, but for the server side.

</br>

I installed node-fetch, because it allows me to do an API fetch via the server side.

```
npm i node-fetch
```
```
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
```

</br>

## :crown: Wishlist

Here's a list of things I'd love to add to Artist Guesser:

- [ ] asdfghjk


<!-- We all know creative developing projects are never _truly_ done..  
These are some next steps that I would love to make:

- Make it possible to let the users search for GIFs
- Let the users save GIFs to a favorites list
- Let the users save GIFs to a special collection, which the user can name themselves (e.g. funny GIFs, cat GIFs, etc.)
- Give Gifinder a random mode, which returns a random GIF to the user after a button press
- Autocomplete user input with a list of valid terms that completes what the user has typed into the input field
- Provide users with a list of GIF categories
- Provide users with a list of the trending search terms
- Suggest searches to users -->
